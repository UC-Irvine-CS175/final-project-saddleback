Pytorch Lightning lets us pass in pretrained models from torch.hub and utilize our dataloader pipeline without any customization needed.\n","\n","## `training_step`\n","- Loop through all our batches over the course of an epoch, saving the loss and logging it per-epoch. Pytorch Lightning abstracted away the actual loop in another function that we are not overriding, because it will often be the same across a wide variety of Machine Learning solutions.\n","\n","## `validation_step`\n","- Similar to the training_step, but in this step we need to see how accurate the model is after learning from the previous training step(s).\n","\n","## `test_step`\n","- In the BPSClassifier, we do not have access to the test data, but it is provided for future use in case it is released or if the dataset author wishes to use it here.\n","\n","## `configure_optimizers`\n","- Set an optimizer (we use Adam here) with a learning rate. You can add a lr scheduler here as well.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hmuiHRhMrN4j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class BPSClassifier(pl.LightningModule):\n","    def __init__ (self, model, n_classes=2, lr=1e-3):\n","\n","        super().__init__()\n","        self.model = model\n","\n","        self.loss_fn = CrossEntropyLoss()\n","        self.accuracy_fn = Accuracy(task='binary', num_classes=2)\n","        self.lr = lr\n","        self.save_hyperparameters\n","\n","    def forward(self, x):\n","        return self.model(x)\n","\n","    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n","        x, y = batch\n","        y_hat = self.forward(y)\n","\n","        loss = self.loss_fn(y_hat, y)\n","        self.log(\"train_loss\", loss, on_step=False, on_epoch=True)\n","\n","        return loss\n","\n","    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n","        x, y = batch\n","        y_hat = self.forward(y)\n","\n","        y_pred = torch.argmax(y_hat, dim=1)\n","        acc = self.accuracy_fn(y_pred, y)\n","\n","        self.log(\"val_loss\", loss, on_step=False, on_epoch=True)\n","        self.log(\"val_accuracy\", acc, on_step=False, on_epoch=True)\n","\n","        return preds\n","\n","    def test_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n","        x, y = batch\n","        y_hat = self.forward(y)\n","\n","        loss = self.loss_fn(y_hat, y)\n","\n","        y_pred = torch.argmax(y_hat, dim=1)\n","        acc = self.accuracy_fn(y_pred, y)\n","\n","        self.log(\"test_loss\", loss)\n","        self.log(\"test_accuracy\", acc)\n","\n","    def configure_optimizers(self):\n","        optimizer = Adam(self.parameters(), lr=self.lr)\n","        return optimizer"],"metadata":{"id":"nRbrPvF7rSc8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Create a wandb session 🪄\n","- The next cell will create a link for you the copy your authorization code.
